/*Task 2 
Task Management System:
    • Create a smart contract that allows users to create and manage tasks on the polygon blockchain.
    • Users can create tasks by providing details such as task name, description, deadline, & assigned users.
    • Tasks can be assigned to multiple users, and each user can have different roles 
        (e.g., creator, assignee, reviewer).
    • Implement functions to update task status, mark tasks as complete, and track task progress.
